# remove-shape
The aim of this project was to solve the problems we experienced because of the shadow and size problems in the picture. For this, we first reduced the size of the image. Then we cleaned up minor noises and sharpened our edges with the median blur filter. We got rid of the shadow with the adaptive function and determined our shapes with the calculation algorithm I wrote.
